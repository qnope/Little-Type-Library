## Introduction
**Little Type Library** or **LTL** for short is a lightweight library that can be used for meta programming and / or functional programming. It can be used instead of **boost::hana** or equivalent because they are too heavy or for whatever reason.
**LTL** is under MIT license, and as such, you can use it without any limitation. I just ask you to signal me every bugs you are going to experience.
This library works under C++ 17.

There is some features that are heavily inspired from C++20 range proposal.

## The different sub-library
+ [Type library](Doc/Type.md):  
  1. Variable carrying type
  2. Compile time computation
  3. Compile time programming in the same way of run time programming
  4. CRTP
+ [Traits library](Doc/Traits.md)
  1. Traits like ordinary function
  2. Concept like
  3. Macro to generate your own traits for your templated types
+ [Tuple library](Doc/Tuple.md)
  1. Tuple like array with square brackets notation
  2. Type manipulation with type list
  3. For each for tuples
+ [Algorithms library](Doc/algorithms.md)
  1. Predicates
  2. No need for iterators
  3. Member function are allowed in algorithms
  4. Find returns option monad
  5. zip
  6. index and enumerate
+ [Functional library](Doc/Functional.md)
  1. Pipeline
  2. Actions
  3. List monad
  3. Option monad
  4. Error monad
  5. Currying
+ [Other utilities](Doc/Other.md)
  1. Condition helpers (`AllOf`, `AnyOf`, `NoneOf`)
  2. Streambuf for write into an array thanks to standard streams
  3. Strong types
  4. Variant helpers and `recursive_variant`

I would like to thanks Ga√©tan Bahl and Nicolas Tollenaere for their advices
